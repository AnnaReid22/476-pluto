<div class="description">
	<p>Our game is a one level adventure to get to Pluto! The player is a rocket, and their goal 
		is to shoot as many asteroids as possible and avoid being hit by them along the 
		way. In addition, on this journey the player will pass many planets, but must 
		avoid crashing into those too!</p>

</div>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>To build the game, the user must have CMake installed, as well as build packages.
		Once installed properly, the user can begin gameplay. The mouse controls the direction
		and the rotation of movement for the rocket. To go forward, the user simply presses the W key.
		To shoot lazers at the asteroids, the user must press the space bar. Winning the game requires
		that the player collide with Pluto, which can be seen at the start of the game and is the goal to get to
		by the end of the game. With these simple controls, the user will be able to play Life on Pluto!

<h2>Audio</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Anna integrated audio into the game. She used SoLoud and MiniAudio, and added sound effects including background 
		noise during gameplay, collisions with asteroids, collisions with planets, a death sound, a win sound, and a 
		sound for when the rocket is flying.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Software Development & Design</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Our engine is modeled similar to Unity, and is very well designed. The game simulation is based on an entity component 
		model where the components of each GameObject are updated every frame according to their own behavior. At the end of 
		each update cycle the render pipeline is executed which is constructed of individual render passes that are encapsulated 
		from each other and are composited in one final render pass which outputs to the screen. This has allowed us to work 
		on our own tasks without interfering with each other, and helping with seamless integration.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>High Performance Camera</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Sarah implemented a strong 3D camera that follows the player’s movement around the 3D space. It has a third person 
		perspective view. It has a spring effect (created using linear interpolation) to smoothly follow the rocket’s rotations 
		and translations.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Complex Environment</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Anna placed all of the planets in the 3D environment and scaled it large, similar to space. The 3D world is on a large 
		scale so that the game appears massive and spans wide. Chris added the skybox for the game and the asteroids. Collisions 
		are in place for the rocket in the 3D space, also.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Animations</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Sarah added animations to the rocket movement. Chris also added asteroid movement over time. Anna added particle 
		systems that move over time and attached them to the rocket’s tail to look like fire, death state, and win state as 
		celebratory particles. Rocket animations are scripted hierarchical modeling animations, but based on their complexity 
		they are considered high performance. List of rocket animations:
	</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
	<ul>
		<li>Squashes when rocket starts and stops moving forward </li>
		<li>Stretches as it moves forward </li>
		<li>Rocket wings rotate as the rocket moves forward </li>
		<li>Gets fat before shooting</li>
		<li>Shakes after shooting</li>
		<li>Loses one wing upon collision with asteroids</li>
		<li>Animation when player wins</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2>Collisions</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Oren implemented bounding spheres for the objects in the scene. In replacement for the bounding sphere hierarchy, 
		we implemented the substitute of a UI that acts in response to collisions and positions of the player in space. 
		Bloom was another potential substitute for the 3D bounding sphere hierarchy.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Shadows</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Anna added shadow mapping as demoed in class. She is still working on it, but will have the asteroid shadows and 
		rocket shadow appear on the planets by the 100% deadline. We are using regular rather than cascaded shadow mapping.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>View Frustum Culling</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Anna added view frustum culling with help from Chris.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Specialized Rendering Techniques: Deferred Shading & Normal Mapping</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Oren added deferred shading to our code. In addition, Oren completed normal mapping for the objects that had normal maps available.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Free Choice: Sophisticated HUD</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Chris has added a GUI during gameplay that shows the user the state of the game (how many asteroids have been hit, how many lives the player has, etc). 
		This is proposed as a substitute for the bounding sphere hierarchy shown above.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Free Choice: Bloom Shading</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Oren implemented bloom into the game, as seen on Pluto.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Free Choice: Particle Systems</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Anna added particle systems to the game, as described above. She added a fire particle system, 
		win state particle system, and a death state particle system.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Free Choice: Scripted Fracturing</h2>
<hr>
<div class="description">
	<p>
		Chris added fracturing asteroids to the game.
	</p>
</div>
